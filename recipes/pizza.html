        <li>For the sauce for this pizza, we recommend preparing our easy Classic Pizza Sauce. With a hint of garlic, salt and basil, it's the ideal pizza sauce that will help to bring out the flavors in the other ingredients used here.</li>
        <li>Fire up your Ooni pizza oven. Aim for 932˚F (500˚C) on the stone baking board inside. You can check the temperature inside your oven quickly and easily using the Ooni Infrared Thermometer.</li>
        <li>Using a small amount of flour, dust your Ooni pizza peel. Stretch the pizza dough ball out to 12″/16″ and lay it out on your pizza peel. Top with the mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza off the peel and into your Ooni pizza oven, making sure to rotate the pizza regularly.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the pizza from the oven and top with whole, fresh basil leaves. Serve immediately.</li>
